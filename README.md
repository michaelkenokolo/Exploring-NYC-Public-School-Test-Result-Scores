# Exploring-NYC-Public-School-Test-Result-Scores
This notebook analyzes the SAT scores of NYC public schools from the schools.csv dataset based on three sections, with each section having a maximum score of 800 points:
1. reading
2. math
3. writing

These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process. Analyzing the performance of schools is also important for stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend.
